# Aim Trainer 🎯

An interactive **Aim Trainer** built to help users improve mouse accuracy, reaction time, and hand–eye coordination. This project serves both as a practical training tool and a programming exercise focused on game logic and user interaction.

## Features
- Click-based target practice
- Real-time score tracking
- Reaction-time focused gameplay
- Simple and clean interface
- Fast-paced and engaging mechanics

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pygame *(remove if not used)*  
- Event-driven programming  
- Basic game loop logic

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subam424/Aim-Trainer.git
